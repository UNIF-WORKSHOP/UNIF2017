		UNIF 2017 will be the 31th in a series of annual international workshops on unification. Previous editions have taken place mostly in 
		Europe (Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland,
		Italy, Poland, UK), but also in the USA and Japan. 
		For more details on previous UNIF workshops, please see
		the <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~treinen/unif/">UNIF homepage</a>.

		Traditionally, the scope of the UNIF workshops has covered the topic of unification in a broad sense, encompassing also 
		research in constraint solving,
		admissibility of inference rules, 
		and applications such as type checking, query answering and 
		cryptographic protocol analysis.

				  One context unification extends first-order unification
				  by introducing a single context variable, possibly with
				  multiple occurrences. One context unification is known
				  to be in NP, but it is not known to be solvable in polynomial
				  time.  In this talk, we motivate the context unification
				  problem through its application in inter-procedural program analysis.
				  We then present an NP procedure for the problem, followed by
				  a polynomial time algorithm for certain interesting classes of
				  the one context unification problem.  The fascinating thing about
				  one context unification is that it is very close to first-order
				  unification and our algorithm itself is presented as an inference
				  system that extends the usual inference rules for first-order
				  unification. The algorithm is of independent value as it can be used,
				  with slight modifications, to solve other problems, such as the
				  first-order unification problem that tolerates one clash.

				Matching is the special case of unification where one of the sides to be unified has no variables and thus remains unchanged under substitutions. In Description Logics (DLs), matching concepts against patterns (concepts with variables) was introduced to help filter out unimportant aspects of complicated concepts appearing in large industrial knowledge bases. Unification of patterns was suggested as a means to detect redundancies in ontologies, by finding different concepts that may potentially stand for the same intuitive notion. Recently, approximate unification was introduced in order to increase the recall of classical unification, i.e., find substitutions that are “almost” unifiers rather than exact unifiers. In the DL FL0, the problem can be reduced to approximately solving formal language equations. Adapting a similar technique, we investigate the language equations obtained from approximate matching in FL0 and provide algorithms to approximately solve said equations.

It is known that in both cases most general unifiers exist for a solvable input constraint. 
A most general unifier consists of a substitution and a set of freshness constraints, where the latter 
is an implicit restriction on the instances of the substitution. 
In the general case with atom variables, we focus in this paper on an improved computation of the most general unifier, and show that a general unifier can be computed in quadratic time. 
Applications of this algorithm are in reasoning about program transformations in higher order functional languages.</div>

decidable class of higher-order unification. These have been used as the 
basic term structure for pattern matching in various computational 
systems, such as higher-order logic programming and higher-order rule 
based computation. However, the class of higher-order patterns is a bit 
restrictive in practice. 

Recently, Libal and Miller present a new decidable class of higher-order 
unification problems called Functions-as-Constructors unification (FCU). 
It extends the class of higher-order patterns and retains good 
properties of pattern unification, namely, it ensures the existence of 
the most general unifier. In this 
abstract, we report that FCU unification can be implemented functionally 
as an extension of Nipkow's functional pattern unification. 
We have implemented the FCU unification 
in Haskell, which has been a part of 
our SOL system for critical pair checking of higher-order rules. </div>

			      We compare two kinds of unification problems: Asymmetric Unification and Disunification, which are variants of Equational Unification. Asymmetric Unification is a type of Equational Unification where the right‑hand sides of the equations are in normal form with respect to the given term 
rewriting system. In Disunification we solve equations and disequations with respect to an equational theory. We contrast the time complexities of both and show that the two problems are 
incomparable: there are theories where one can be solved in polynomial time while the other is NPhard. This goes both ways. The time complexity also varies based on the termination ordering used in the term rewriting system.</div>

		</div>
		<div id="abs1" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">Unification theory has found significant applications in cryptographic protocol analysis, but that is not the only security area in which it can be applied. Here we discuss recent research in the automatic generation and verification of cryptographic algorithms, and show how it can be used to find attacks on modes of encryption. We describe an algorithm we have recently developed based on the Baader-Schulz combination procedure, and we discuss some open research problems.

		</div>
		<div id="abs2" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">
		  We describe a matching algorithm to solve the so-called letrec matching problem. 
		  The meta-expressions occurring in the matching equations stem from a meta-language that uses higher-order abstract syntax augmented by meta-notation for recursive let, contexts, sets of bindings, and chain variables. Additionally, three kinds of constraints can be added to meta-expressions to express usual constraints on evaluation rules and program transformations. 
		  We provide a sound and complete matching algorithm ithat it runs in non-deterministic polynomial time. We show that the letrec matching problem is NP-complete.

		</div>
		<div id="abs3" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">
		  We consider the generalisation of nominal unification where besides expression variables, also atom variables are considered. It is known that in both cases most general unifiers exist for a solvable input constraint. 
A most general unifier consists of a substitution and a set of freshness constraints, where the latter 
is an implicit restriction on the instances of the substitution. 
In the general case with atom variables, we focus in this paper on an improved computation of the most general unifier, and show that a general unifier can be computed in quadratic time. 
Applications of this algorithm are in reasoning about program transformations in higher order functional languages.

		  We compare two kinds of unification problems: Asymmetric Unification and Disunification, which are variants of Equational Unification. Asymmetric Unification is a type of Equational Unification where the right‑hand sides of the equations are in normal form with respect to the given term 
rewriting system. In Disunification we solve equations and disequations with respect to an equational theory. We contrast the time complexities of both and show that the two problems are 
incomparable: there are theories where one can be solved in polynomial time while the other is NPhard. This goes both ways. The time complexity also varies based on the termination ordering used in the term rewriting system.

		  </div>
		  <div id="abs7" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">
		  Matching is the special case of unification where one of the sides to be unified has no variables and thus remains unchanged under substitutions. In Description Logics (DLs), matching concepts against patterns (concepts with variables) was introduced to help filter out unimportant aspects of complicated concepts appearing in large industrial knowledge bases. Unification of patterns was suggested as a means to detect redundancies in ontologies, by finding different concepts that may potentially stand for the same intuitive notion. Recently, approximate unification was introduced in order to increase the recall of classical unification, i.e., find substitutions that are “almost” unifiers rather than exact unifiers. In the DL FL0, the problem can be reduced to approximately solving formal language equations. Adapting a similar technique, we investigate the language equations obtained from approximate matching in FL0 and provide algorithms to approximately solve said equations.

		We consider a syntax for nominal terms extended with non-capturing atom substitution and show that unification over such terms is undecidable. 
The proof of undecidability is obtained by reducing Hilbert's tenth problem to unification of extended nominal terms, adapting Goldfarb's proof of undecidability of second-order unification.

		</div>
		<div id="abs9" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">
		It is widely known that Miller's higher-order patterns provide a 
decidable class of higher-order unification. These have been used as the 
basic term structure for pattern matching in various computational 
systems, such as higher-order logic programming and higher-order rule 
based computation. However, the class of higher-order patterns is a bit 
restrictive in practice. 

Recently, Libal and Miller present a new decidable class of higher-order 
unification problems called Functions-as-Constructors unification (FCU). 
It extends the class of higher-order patterns and retains good 
properties of pattern unification, namely, it ensures the existence of 
the most general unifier. In this 
abstract, we report that FCU unification can be implemented functionally 
as an extension of Nipkow's functional pattern unification. 
We have implemented the FCU unification 
in Haskell, which has been a part of 
our SOL system for critical pair checking of higher-order rules.
