Call for Papers: UNIF 2017 -- FSCD workshop

Website: https://unif-workshop.github.io/UNIF2017/

The 31st International Workshop on Unification is the 31st event in a
series of international meetings devoted to unification theory and its
applications.  Unification is concerned with the problem of making two
terms equal, finding solutions for equations, or making formulas
equivalent.  It is a fundamental process used in a number of fields of
computer science, including automated reasoning, term rewriting, logic
programming, natural language processing, program analysis, types, etc.

The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a yearly forum for
researchers in unification theory and related fields to meet old and
new colleagues, to present recent (even unfinished) work, and to
discuss new ideas and trends.  It is also a good opportunity for young
researchers and scientists working in related areas to get an overview
of the state of the art in unification theory.  The workshop will be
hosted by the 2nd tInternational Conference on Formal Structures for
Computation and Deduction (FSCD, Oxford, September 2017)

** Submission instructions **

Following the tradition of UNIF, we call for submissions of abstracts
(5 pages) in EasyChair style, to be submitted electronically as PDF
files through the EasyChair submission site:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2017

Abstracts will be evaluated by the Programme Committee (if necessary
with support from external reviewers) regarding their significance for
the workshop.

Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included in
the informal proceedings of the workshop, available in printed form at
the workshop and in electronic form from the UNIF homepage:

Based on the number and quality of submissions we will decide whether
to organize a special journal issue.
